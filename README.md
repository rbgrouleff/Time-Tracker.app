# Time Tracker

Time Tracker is the simplest macOS app for tracking time working for clients, I can imagine. Read about, why I built it [on my website](https://nerdd.dk/2025/06/11/scratching-my-own-itch/).

You can add clients:

You can add projects to clients:

You can track time spent on projects:

And you can register time invoiced to projects

And that is pretty much it.
